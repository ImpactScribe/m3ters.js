## M3ter Head
<p align="center"><img src='./img/M3ter-head.svg'/></p>
Avatars to infuse a touch of whimsy and individuality into the M3tering Protocol. Generate one-of-a-kind SVG avatars that serve as distinctive visual representations for device DIDs and blockchain address strings commonly encountered in the M3tering Protocol.

### Usage:

1. Import the `M3terHead` component into your React code:

   ```javascript
   import * as React from 'react';
   import M3terHead from 'm3ter-head';
   ```

2. Render the avatar within your component, providing a unique seed string for generation:

   ```jsx
   export default class MyComponent extends React.Component {
     render() {
       return (
         <div>
           <M3terHead seed={"device_DID_string"} />
         </div>
       );
     }
   }
   ```
